# README - PHOTOS PROJECT #

This project was created by Neel Patel and Stephanie Ng - Team 62. Please note that this project was made and tested on the Windows 10 operating system. 

The idea for this project was to make a Photo Gallery app that had the following functions. We decided to use this opportunity to build a User Interface and experience that promoted ease of use and accessibility.
With easy to understand icons at the appropriate places, the location of the various features and functions will become second nature to the user.
